If you've created partitions using gdisk and want to remove them, you'll need to use the same tool to delete the partitions. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Using gdisk to Remove Partitions:
Launch gdisk on the Block Device:

Replace /dev/xvda with your actual block device.

bash
Copy code
sudo gdisk /dev/xvda
View the Current Partition Table:

Type p and press Enter to print the current partition table.
Note the partition numbers you want to delete.
Delete Partitions:

Type d and press Enter to delete a partition.
Enter the partition number when prompted.
Repeat for Additional Partitions:

If you have multiple partitions to delete, repeat the d command for each one.
Command (? for help):

After deleting partitions, type p to print the partition table and verify the changes.
Write Changes to Disk:

If you are satisfied with the changes, type w and press Enter to write the changes to the disk.
Confirm the action by typing Y and pressing Enter.
Quit:

Type q and press Enter to quit gdisk.
Important Notes:
Deleting partitions using gdisk removes the partition entries but doesn't immediately erase the data within the deleted partitions.
If you want to reclaim space and remove filesystems within those partitions, you'll need to use tools like mkfs to delete the filesystems first.
Deleting partitions may result in data loss, so ensure that you have backed up any important data before proceeding.
After completing these steps, the specified partitions should be deleted, and the changes will be written to the disk. Always exercise caution when modifying disk partitions, as it can lead to data loss if not done carefully.
